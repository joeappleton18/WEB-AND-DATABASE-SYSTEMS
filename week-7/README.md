# Overview

This week, we are going to be looking at how to construct simple Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) web pages. We will also be looking at how to style these pages using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Further to this, we will complete the database section of the module by undertaking a group modeling exercise in the lab.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

- Describe the key concepts of HTML and CSS
- Construct simple HTML web pages
- Style HTML web pages using CSS
- Model a database using Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)

## How are we going to learn this?

- **Lecture:** The lecture, delivered by me (Joe Appleton), will cover the high level concepts of the Web.

- **Lab:** The modeling will take place in the lab.

- **Pre-learning:** The HTML and CSS will be covered in the pre-learning video. The video is a follow-along tutorial that will cover all of the key concepts of HTML and CSS required for this module. If you feel you already have a good understanding of HTML and CSS, you can skip the video.
