# Space Park Website

This is a simple website, demonstrating the use of HTML and CSS.

I created this website as a pre-learning project for the database section of Surrey's Web and Database Systems module.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser. 


## Accessing the Website

I have enabled GitHub Pages for this repository, so you can access the website [here](https://joeappleton18.github.io/space-park/).

## Further Learning 

Can you make your own portfolio website? If you're interested in learning more about HTML and CSS, I recommend the following resources:

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/)
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics)


When complete, you can host your website for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
