# Overview

This week, we are going to be introducing the basics of JavaScript. We will be looking at how to construct simple JavaScript programs. Further, we will be looking at how to run these programs in the Node.js runtime environment. Before we get started, we'll consider how we can update our development environment to support JavaScript development.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

- Describe the key concepts of JavaScript
- Construct simple JavaScript programs
- Run JavaScript programs in Node.js
- Use variables and conditional statements in JavaScript
- Use loops in JavaScript
- Use functions in JavaScript
  

## How are we going to learn this?

- **Lecture:** In the lecture, we will consider the web development landscape and introduce the key concepts of JavaScript. You will also be introduced to the Node.js runtime environment. I hope, by the end of the lecture, you'll agree that the web development landscape is continually evolving and is a very exciting place to be.

- **Lab:** In the lab we are going to have some fun and create some simple JavaScript programs. We will also be looking at how to run these programs in the Node.js runtime environment.
