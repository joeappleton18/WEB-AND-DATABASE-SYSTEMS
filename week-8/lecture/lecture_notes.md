 # From the Internet to the Web


## What is the internet?

- The internet is a network of networks. 
- Deices connected to the internet can communicate with each other using the Internet Protocol (IP).
- The internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide.


## What is the web?

- The web is a collection of documents and other resources, linked by hyperlinks and URLs.
- The web is a service that operates over the internet.

## How does the internet work?

- Each network interface of a networked computer on the Internet (host) has a unique address (~street number).
- Data from one host is sent to another host using the Internet Protocol (IP). The data is sent in packets. Each packet contains the IP address of the sender and the receiver. For example the pack could look like this:

## Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

- TCP is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation through which application programs can exchange data.
- TCP works with the Internet Protocol (IP), which defines how computers send packets of data to each other.
- Together, TCP and IP are the basic rules defining the Internet.

# # Trace Route

- Traceroute is a computer network diagnostic tool for displaying the route (path) and measuring transit delays of packets across an Internet Protocol (IP) network.
- The history of the route is recorded as the round-trip times of the packets received from each successive host (remote node) in the route (path); the sum of the mean times in each hop indicates the total time spent to establish the connection.
